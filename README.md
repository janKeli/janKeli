## Hello, world
My name is jan Keli ([IPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet): `/jan'keli/`).

I'm trying to externalize my brain and keep as much of it as I can public, you can find my working notes [here](https://jankeli.github.io).

Here's the [list of projects](https://jankeli.github.io/now/) that I'll start working on on 2024-11-15.

I don't really know how to talk to people, so I want to get feedback on literally everything. Please create an issue or [email](mailto:janelikan@proton.me) if you have any!
